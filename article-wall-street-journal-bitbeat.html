Stockman Wants IRS to Reconsider Bitcoin Decision</h1><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/04/08/bitbeat-rep-stockman-wants-irs-to-reconsider-bitcoin-decision/" target=_blank><img src=/img/pr-moneybeat.8e56.png alt="Wall Street Journal" class="responsive pr-image"></a><p><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong><br>8 April 2014</p><h3>From the Inside Bitcoins Conference:</h3><p>- <strong>Rep. Steve Stockman (R, Texas) was at the Inside Bitcoins conference</strong> in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, sharing a bill he plans to introduce in Congress asking the IRS to reconsider its decision earlier this month declaring <a href=http://www.wsj.com/video/what-a-bitcoin/D79FF38C-7816-435B-B3B0-F9B177BCA0A8.html data-ls-seen=1>bitcoin</a> property for tax purposes.</p><p>The bill currently is a draft, a mere one page, directing the IRS to treat bitcoin as currency for tax purposes. Of course, the goal of the bill isn&rsquo;t necessarily to get Congress to codify bitcoin into law. Rep. Stockman, an aficionado who accepted bitcoin donations for his reelection campaign, is looking to get a conversation going on the topic.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s not accurate,&rdquo; he said of the IRS ruling. To him, bitcoin is not a commodity, but a currency. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not sugar, it&rsquo;s not gold.&rdquo; Rep. Stockman concedes to one major problem: There is still much debate, even at the conference, about what bitcoin actually is. He suggested we go into the conference and ask 10 different people, much like he did. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get 10 different answers.&rdquo;</p><p>Regardless, he plans to introduce his bill later this month. Understanding how slowly Congress moves, and knowing how few of his fellow lawmakers are up on developments in digital currency (if not outright hostile), he isn&rsquo;t necessarily looking for action there. What he really wants is just to stir up debate on the question, in the hope that the IRS changes its stance.</p><p>&ldquo;The IRS can act quicker than Congress,&rdquo; he said. <em>(Paul Vigna)</em></p><p><strong>Read the full article</strong> : <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/04/08/bitbeat-rep-stockman-wants-irs-to-reconsider-bitcoin-decision/" target=_blank>Here</a></p></div><div class="grid-3 pressnav-shell"><h3>Press Archive</h3><div id=tabs><ul><li><a href=#latest title="">Latest</a></li><li><a href=#top title="">Top</a></li></ul><div id=tabs_container class="grid-3 pressnav"><div id=latest><ul><li class=article-node-interview><a href=article-node-interview><h3>n-o-d-e</h3>The MaidSafe Interview: Privacy.
